# AirBnB Clone V3

## Authors
- Mark Ongaro
- Nessy Mukami

## Project Overview
This project builds upon previous versions of the AirBnB clone by introducing and integrating REST API functionality with Flask. Our aim is to deepen the understanding of back-end services and apply these in a real-world-like scenario, enhancing the AirBnB clone with scalable, maintainable, and robust API services.

## Key Concepts
This project requires a comprehensive understanding of the following key areas:
- REST APIs
- Flask application development
- Modular software architecture

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, participants should be able to:
- Describe what REST and APIs are, and how they interconnect.
- Differentiate between different types of APIs.
- Identify and use the appropriate HTTP methods for retrieving, creating, updating, and deleting resources.
- Implement and consume a REST API in a web application.

## Requirements

### Python Scripts
- **Editors:** vi, vim, emacs
- **Environment:** All scripts must run on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.4.3.
- **Style:** Code must adhere to PEP 8 style guidelines.
- **Documentation:** All modules, classes, and functions must include descriptive documentation.

### Python Unit Tests
- **Location:** All test files should reside within a `tests` folder.
- **Framework:** Utilize the `unittest` framework for all Python tests.
- **Execution:** Run tests using the command: `python3 -m unittest discover tests`. Individual tests can be executed with specific commands.

## Collaboration Notes
- Collaborative efforts on test cases are encouraged to ensure comprehensive coverage and discovery of potential edge cases.
